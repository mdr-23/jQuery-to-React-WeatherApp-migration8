# Weather App (jQuery to React Migration)

This is a weather application that has been migrated from jQuery to React. It allows users to search for weather information based on a specific location.

## Features

- Enter a city name to search for weather information
- Display current temperature and weather condition for the searched location

## Getting Started

To run the migrated React application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Migration Details

This project is a migration from jQuery to React. The original version of the application was built using jQuery, and it has been refactored to use React components and hooks for better maintainability and scalability.

The migration process involved rewriting the existing jQuery code using React components and leveraging React's state management and lifecycle methods. The main benefits of this migration include improved code organization, easier debugging, and enhanced performance.

During the migration, the jQuery-based API calls were replaced with asynchronous fetch requests using the `fetch` function and the `useEffect` hook provided by React. This allowed for a more seamless integration with the Weather API.

Feel free to explore the codebase to see how the migration was performed and to compare the jQuery and React versions of the application.

## Conclusion

The weather application has been successfully migrated from jQuery to React, leveraging React's component-based structure and state management. The migration process involved rewriting the application using React components and modern JavaScript practices, resulting in improved code maintainability and extensibility.

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications or improvements. Contributions are welcome!
